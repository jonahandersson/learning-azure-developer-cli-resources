*The Azure Developer CLI (azd) is an open-source tool that accelerates provisioning and deploying app resources on Azure. azd provides best practice, developer-friendly commands that map to key stages in your development workflow, whether you're working in the terminal, an integrated development environment (IDE), or through CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment) pipelines.*

These templates include:*
- *Reusable infrastructure as code assets to provision cloud resources services using Bicep or Terraform.*
- *Proof-of-concept or starter app code that can be customized or replaced with your own app code.*
- *Configuration files to handle deploying your app to the provisioned resources.*
- *Optionally, pipeline workflow files for GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines to enable CI/CD integrations.*
